# Optimization


The goal of this lab is to write a simple optimization function in **R** which estimates the global minimum of a convex differentiable function $f(x)$.  Specifically, consider the function 
$$f(x)=\frac{-\log(x)}{1+x}, \ \ x>0,$$
where $\log(x)$ is the natural logarithm of $x$.  We seek to estimate the value of $x>0$ such that $f(x)$ achieves its global minimum.  For example, the global minimum of the function $g(x)=x^2-4x+3$ is at $x=2$. The minimum of $g(x)$ can easily be computed using the vertex formula for quadratic functions, i.e., $x=-b/(2a)=4/(2*1)=2$.  In most cases, the minimum does not have a closed form solution and must be computed numerically.  Hence we seek to estimate the global minimum of $f(x)$ numerically via gradient descent.    

# Tasks

1) Using **R**, define the function $$f(x)=\frac{-\log(x)}{1+x}, \ \ x>0.$$ Test the points $f(0)$ and $f(2)$.  
```{r, error=TRUE}
f <- function(x){
  stopifnot(x>0)
  return(-log(x)/(1+x))
}
f(0)
f(2)
```


2) Plot the function $f(x)$ over the interval $(0,6]$. 
```{r}

curve(f, from = .Machine$double.eps, to = 6, col = "red")
curve(f, from = 1, to = 6, col = "red")
```

3)  By inspection, were do you think global minimum is located at?  
Maybe at some point betweem 3 to 4.

4) Define a **R** function which computes the difference quotient of $f(x)$, i.e., for $h>0$, 
$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$ This function should have two inputs; $h$ and $x$.  Name the difference quotient function **diff.quot**.  Note that for small $h$,  this function is the approximate derivative of $f(x)$.    
```{r}
diff.quot <- function(x, h){
  return((f(x+h) - f(x))/h)
}
```

5) Plot both the difference quotient function **diff.quot** and $f(x)$ over the interval $(0,6]$.  Fix $h=.0001$ to construct this plot.  Comment on any interesting features.
```{r}
plot(seq(.Machine$double.eps, 6, .1), 
     diff.quot(x = seq(.Machine$double.eps, 6, .1), h = 0.0001), 'l', col = "blue")
```
This diff.quot function looks very similar to the mirror image on X-axis of the original function. 

6) Write a **R** function named **basic.grad.descent** that runs the basic gradient descent algorithm on the function $f(x)$.
The function should have inputs:  
```{r}
basic.grad.descent <- function(x, max.iter=10000, 
                               stop.deriv=1e-10, h=.0001, step.scale=5){
  for(i in 1:max.iter){
    
    step.deriv <- diff.quot(x, h)
    # oppsite direction
    x <- x - step.scale*step.deriv
    if(abs(step.deriv <= stop.deriv)){ break()}
  }
  fit <- list(x = x, minimum_f = f(x), number_iters = i, converged = (i < max.iter))
  return(fit)
}

basic.grad.descent(.001)
```


\begin{enumerate}
\item Initial value  {\bf x}
\item Maximum iterations  {\bf max.iter} with default 10000. 
\item Stopping criterion {\bf stop.deriv} with default 1e-10. 
\item Derivative step size {\bf h} with default .0001.  
\item Step size {\bf step.scale} with default .5. 
\end{enumerate} The function should have outputs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The value $x$ that yields the minimum of $f(x)$. 
\item The minimum value of $f(x)$. 
\item The number of iterations the algorithm took to reach the minimum.
\item A logical indicator displaying whether or not the algorithm converged.  
\end{enumerate}

7)  Check the optimal value using the base **R** function **nlm()**.
